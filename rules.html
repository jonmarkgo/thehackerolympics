            <h3>Welcome to the Hacker Olympics</h3>
            <p>What follows is an explanation of the general principles that govern the Hacker Olympics and allow it to be a fun experience for everyone.</p>

            <h4>The Rules:</h4>
            <ul class="square">
                <li>First off don't break the rules. If you break any of the rules, we have an angry cabbie standing by. His job is to shame rule breakers by publicly screaming at them in front of their friends and family until they are brought to tears. Do not mess with the cabbie.</li>
                <li>Required challenges are required. You must perform these tasks or you will be disqualified.</li>
                <li>Required challenges must be scheduled in advance so that we can keep the games moving quickly, thus guaranteeing we can all head home at a reasonable time to re-watch last season of Game of Thrones while taking notes.</li>
                <li>Some challenges require or suggest forming teams. There is a maximum team size denoted on these challenges.</li>
                <li> Don't cheat. This means don't copy a friends code if it is not a team challenge. Our skilled staff will notice and you will not receive any points for that challenge. And if you cheat, you will have 0% fun.</li>
                <li>Please don't scare the unicorn.</li>
                <li>No Larping. Even if you have a light saber from last year. Larping kills.</li>
            </ul>
            

            <h4>The Format:</h4>
            <ul class="square">
                <li>There are <b>2 Rounds</b> throughout the day. The morning session and the afternoon session. You will be given a subset of challenges for each session and are encouraged to complete as many as humanly possible.</li>
                <li>For each challenge you complete you will receive a fixed or variable amount of points.</li>
                <li>When you are finished with a challenge, please hail a yellow shirted volunteer and they will accept or decline your demo.</li>
                <li>If you finish all available challenges, notify a volunteer and they will supply you with a bonus challenge.</li>
            </ul>
                

            <h4>Scoring:</h4>
            <ul class="square">
                <li> Fixed point challenges: A challenge in which completion is scored as pass/fail. These are denoted by a red header. </li>
                <li> Variable point challenges: A challenge in which completion is scored on a scale, where the maximum points are shown for the challenge. These are denoted by a blue header. </li>
                <li> In team challenges each participant receives the points shown on the challenge.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr id="required" />
