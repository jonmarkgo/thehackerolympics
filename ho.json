Teams complete challenges to earn points, each of which make hackers think quickly, creatively and often outside their comfort zone.</p><p>Participate in teams of 4 - 6 people in front-end, back-end, or cross-discipline challenges. Knockout your competition with a red shell in the Mario Kart tournament. Use skills you didn’t know you had to reign victorious over the likes of Startup Charades, cryptography challenges, code puzzles, building of a meme generator, and more.</p>"
